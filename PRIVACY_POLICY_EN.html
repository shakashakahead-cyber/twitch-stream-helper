  <h1>Privacy Policy for Twitch Stream Helper</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025-09-12</p>

  <p>This browser extension, "Twitch Stream Helper" (hereinafter "the Extension"), is a tool designed to help streamers manage their Twitch stream title, category, tags, and assist with posting to X (formerly Twitter).</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Twitch Access Token</strong>: We obtain an access token through Twitch's OAuth protocol when you explicitly log in. This token is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Stream Information (Title, Category, Tags)</strong>: We retrieve and update your own channel information, such as the stream title, category, and tags, using the official Twitch API.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Transmission and Sharing</h2>
  <p>The Extension does not transmit your data to any external servers. All communication occurs directly and exclusively with official Twitch domains.</p>

  <h2>Purpose of Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To retrieve and update your stream title, category, and tags.</li>
    <li>To open the X (formerly Twitter) composer window for you to review and post.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete the access token at any time by using the logout function within the Extension. All locally stored data is permanently deleted when you uninstall the Extension from your browser.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The Extension requires only the `identity` and `storage` permissions. Host permissions are strictly limited to the two necessary Twitch API domains.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This Extension is an unofficial tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed, or sponsored by Twitch Interactive, Inc.</p>
